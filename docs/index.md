## Getting Started

This **[website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)** contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [**Introduction to Algorithms** _Third Edition_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition), published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest), and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

I hope to organize solutions to help people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files and [KaTeX](https://katex.org) math library, this page is much more readable on portable devices.

_"Many a little makes a mickle."_

## Motivation

I build this website since I want to help everyone learn algorithms by providing something easy to read on mobile devices.

Therefore, if any adjustment is needed or you have the same motivation to contribute to this work, please don't hesitate to give me your feedback. You can press the "pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the content or [open an issue](https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Cormen-Sol/issues/new) in [this repository](https://github.com/Chaganti-Reddy/Cormen-Sol/). Your solution will be rebased after I review it and make some form modifications to your pull request.

Thank you very much, and I hope that everyone will learn algorithms smoothly.

## How I Generate the Website?

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website.

As for rendering math equations, I use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which is fast and beautiful.

I also add `overflow-x: auto` to prevent the overflow issue on small screen devices so that you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.

## More Information

For a clear commit history, I rebase my repository regularly. Therefore, if you have forked the repository before, consider re-forking it again.
